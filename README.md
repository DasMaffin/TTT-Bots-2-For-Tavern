## What is this?
This is a player bot addon for the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode in Garry's Mod. It is currently a **WIP**.

It is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing for easy customization and expansion. It is designed for TTT2, while being fully playable in regular TTT.

## How to use
1. Download the latest version from the Steam Workshop **(Will go here when ready)**
2. Start a p2p or dedicated server with sufficient player slots on a map with a navmesh or on one of the included maps.
3. *As a superadmin,* either type `!addbot X` in chat, or write `ttt_bot_add X` in the console.
4. You're done!
