## What is this?
This is a player bot addon for the Trouble in Terrorist Town game mode in Garry's Mod.

It is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing easy customization and expansion. It is designed for TTT2 while being fully playable in regular TTT.

üìù Note: Please stick to the main branch. Most other branches are either unstable or significantly behind.

## How to use
1. Download the latest version from the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1256344426).
2. Start a Peer-to-Peer or SRCDS with sufficient player slots on a map with a navmesh or one of the included maps.
3. *As a super admin,* either type `!botadd X` in chat or write `ttt_bot_add X` in the console.
4. You're done!

## Role Support

This add-on supports a wide range of roles. Here are some that have explicit compatibility:
* Jester
* Jackal
* Sidekick
* Hitman (needs work)
* Serial Killer
* Survivalist

The mod also auto-generates compatibility with custom roles, but it is imperfect. It does not comprehend most 'public killer' roles (e.g., 'Speedrunner').

## Usage and Commands
A basic usage guide can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2/wiki/Basic-Usage-Guide). It will give you all the info you need for 90% of cases. A more in-depth set of guides are constantly a WIP.

## Vague to-do list
- Complete everything in the Issues section (impossible)
- Create some more bot maps as separate addons, but link them here.
- Implement the !botmenu: blacklist/whitelist certain traits, change bot count, etc.
- Have bots be able to use the DNA scanner (maybe)

## For developers
[Check out the developer guide](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/TTT-Bots-2/wiki/Developer-Guide).

Please help me document/improve the codebase! I would highly appreciate it. And you can have bots get named after you!
