⚠️⚠️⚠️ WARNING: THIS IS NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

While the mod is less than a week from release, I wouldn't recommend using it just yet, as there are still some items left to tweak.

![TTT Bots Header](tttbots-banner2.png)
## What is this?
This is a player bot addon for the Trouble in Terrorist Town game mode in Garry's Mod. It is currently a **WIP**.

It is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing for easy customization and expansion. It is designed for TTT2 while being fully playable in regular TTT.

## How to use
1. Download the latest version from the Steam Workshop **(Will go here when ready)**
2. Start a p2p or dedicated server with sufficient player slots on a map with a navmesh or on one of the included maps.
3. *As a super admin,* either type `!about X` in chat, or write `ttt_bot_add X` in the console.
4. You're done!

## Commands
TODO: Put a wiki here

## Progress:
Basically this is a to-do list before full Steam release

Note that this list is far from comprehensive, and only serves to give you a rough list in order of priority.

Prior to release:
- Enable bots to have 'silly chats' the way they did before, and let them have basic conversations with each other.
- Create a wiki for server owners and general tips

Post-release:
- Create trailer for new mod, take new screenshots, make everything more professional.
- Custom Tutorial on how to fine-tune navmeshes + how to let bots use ladders
- Create some more bot maps as separate addons but link them here.
- Implement the !botmenu: blacklist/whitelist certain traits, change bot count, etc.
- Have bots be able to emulate using the DNA scanner (??)
