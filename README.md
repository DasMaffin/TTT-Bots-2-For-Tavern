## What is this?
This is a player bot addon for the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode in Garry's Mod. It is currently a **WIP**.

It is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing for easy customization and expansion. It is designed for TTT2, while being fully playable in regular TTT.

## How to use
1. Download the latest version from the Steam Workshop **(Will go here when ready)**
2. Start a p2p or dedicated server with sufficient player slots on a map with a navmesh or on one of the included maps.
3. *As a superadmin,* either type `!addbot X` in chat, or write `ttt_bot_add X` in the console.
4. You're done!

## Commands
TODO: Put a wiki here

## Progress:
Basically this is a to-do list before full Steam release

Note that this list is far from comprehensive, and only serves to give you a rough list in order of priority:
- Place a health station if is detective
- Allow bots to heal from health stations
- Have bots be able to use the DNA scanner
- Avoid areas spotted with bombs close by, and communicate when spotting a bomb.
- Ensure TTT/2 cross-compatibility

Misc stuff, aka probably after release:
- CUSTOM Tutorial on how to create navmeshes + how to let them use ladders
- Push the first 'ready' build to Steam
- Extreme baby-proofing: tell user if no navmesh, no player slots, etc. Maybe even link them to tutorial from #2.
- Ban certain traits from being selected, have a UI to explain assigned traits
- Have a full UI for bot customization
