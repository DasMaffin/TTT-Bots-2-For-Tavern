## Contributing
To start, thank you for wanting to contribute. The guidelines are pretty straightforward:

1. **Explain** -- What is your PR changing? Why is it changing that section? How does it change it?
2. **Compatibility** -- Please make sure your PR is cross-compatible between TTT and TTT2 before submitting.
3. **Clean code** -- Ensure your code is clean and concise. If you add complex functions, use [Lua LS](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/)'s annotation style to document your functions.
4. **Optimization** -- Most important. If your changes hinder performance significantly, it should be optimized before submission.


Some basic rejection criteria, excluding the obvious above points:

1. **No explanation** -- If you make changes without explaining why (given it's not self-explanatory), your PR will likely be rejected.
2. **Opinion** -- Pull requests may be subject to opinion, so if you're significantly changing how the bots play, please justify your reasons. If it contradicts how I want the bots to play (e.g., too cheaty), please understand that it may be rejected.
